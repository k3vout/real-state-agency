## Notes

- What was the hardest thing you had to solve while building the website?
  - The pagination feature took more time than the other features.
- Are there any areas of your code that you think isn't that "clean"?
  - Maybe the html should be improved.
- If you weren't able to finish: what were you able to complete and were you happy with your progress given the time constraints?
